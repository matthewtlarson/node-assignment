# ReamMe Generator
First I inluded the packages necessary to properly run my application,
Then I created an array of questions linked to a specific variable,
I created questions for each corresponding ReadMe section as inputs,
Next I created a list of licenses to chose from with choices,
Then I wrote the function to properly create the Readme file,
After I made sure the data from the user's answers were being pushed to the new file,
Then on my 'generate markdown' I returned each piece of data.
